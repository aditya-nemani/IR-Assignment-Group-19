ibm interested in mechanisms for communicating between disjoint processes,
possibly, but not eiculslxevy, in a discerned ervmneninot.  i word-order see deviations of complete mechanisms, wish or wishout interrelationships opposed to theoretical work on the abstract pbelrom.  rome processinghas and message-passing are enables of my interests.
